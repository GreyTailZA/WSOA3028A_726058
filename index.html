        I don’t really know what to write for this first Development blog, 
        so I’m just going to ramble a bit about what I did. We had to design our wireframe, 
        which was relatively simple, and I think I can achieve everything I want to do with my website. 
        URL naming conventions and directory structure was also emphasized, and I think I got it right, 
        but we’ll have to see. I had some trouble getting Git to recognize my folders and index file, 
        but it seems to be fixed now. All of this seems complicated and simple at the same time and 
        considering that I did this course last year (sort of) I’m hoping that that will help with the 
        HTML portion at least. I realize that this first blog is very colloquial, but again I don’t 
        really know what we’re supposed to be writing in these.</p>

        Learning about URL design. The emphasis on simplicity and readability makes sense and seems 
        simple enough to do. The main problem will be ensuring that the actual directory paths work 
        properly and keeping the files organized. An important question will be how I will name my 
        blogs. Right now, I’m thinking I’ll keep the Dev blogs as “Development Blog-date” and the 
        extra blogs will get appropriate titles depending on their contents. Finalized my wireframe, 
        got some good ideas. Now I just need to actually start working on making the website, as 
        right now it is still just a mostly blank webpage with a title. Which may be difficult 
        as I still have almost no idea of how GitHub and all that stuff works, even after reading 
        and watching some tutorials.

        Okay, so I'm completely lost. I have half an idea of what I'm supposed to be doing, but half
        isn't really good enough. I need to stop messing around and start asking for help. Which I still 
        haven't done. Which is bad. I can't even remember how to push stuff to GitHub properly. I'll be 
        sure to ask on Monday and Tuesday for help to make sure i get this sorted. Also watch some more 
        tutorials over the weekend to try and understand what I need to do.

        Okay, so that didn't go well. Spent the weekend half dead of a fever and got nothing done. Which is bad. 
        Very bad. AND we have a hand in on Friday. Which I have nothing for. I'm just going to try throw 
        something together so I can hand in, but that's not going to be enough. I'm still lost on this stuff. 
        Well, seeing as we're going to be including these blog posts in the hand in I guess that'll be the "Hi, I 
        need help, please" I'v failed to give right now. I've also realised that I'm horrendously behind on the reading 
        and character blogs. Not impossibly behind, yet, but still too behind for my liking. Why is coding always so hard 
        for me to grasp. T_T.
